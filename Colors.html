What is nature? There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the 
animals, the birds, the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields 
and so on. Nature is not put together by thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the 
tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power.
